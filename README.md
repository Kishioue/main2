What is Big O for this algorithm?
The Big O notation for the brute-force string matching algorithm is (O(n \cdot m)), where (n) is the length of the text and (m) is the length of the pattern. This means that in the worst case, the algorithm may have to look at every character in the text for each character in the pattern.

Did your calculations of elapsedTime align with what the book said about Big O?
Yes! In the best-case scenario (when the pattern is an empty string), the elapsed time is very short because no characters are compared. In the worst-case scenario (like having a pattern longer than the text), it takes significantly longer, which matches the expectations for the algorithm’s complexity.

What do you think is the purpose of the exercise?
The exercise helps to show how different inputs affect the performance of an algorithm. It’s a way to connect the theory of algorithm complexity (Big O) with real-world execution times, making it easier to understand.

Is this enough to calculate a best- and worst-case scenario?
Yes, it provides a basic way to calculate best- and worst-case scenarios. The best-case (empty pattern) runs almost instantly, while the worst-case (mismatched pattern) takes longer. However, exploring more scenarios could give a fuller picture of performance.
